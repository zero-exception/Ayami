# What is Ayami all about?

Project Ayami is a small bot that was created to help Genshin Impact players spend less time searching for various useful information regarding game characters. 
Most players have a Discord account, so I decided to use Discord as the platform. Besides, I'm quite familiar with Discord API.

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Easy-to-read images with data for each in-game character (1/144 images are already created)
 - [ ] Resin replenishment reminders system
 - [ ] Image generation instead of using premade ones (I really doubt this ever happens btw)
